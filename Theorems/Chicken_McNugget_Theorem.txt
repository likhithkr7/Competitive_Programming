The Chicken McNugget Theorem (or Postage Stamp Problem or Frobenius Coin Problem) states that for any two relatively prime positive integers m,n, the greatest integer that cannot be written in the form am + bn for nonnegative integers a, b is mn-m-n.

A consequence of the theorem is that there are exactly ((m - 1)*(n - 1))/2 positive integers which cannot be expressed in the form am + bn. The proof is based on the fact that in each pair of the form (k, mn-m-n-k), exactly one element is expressible.
